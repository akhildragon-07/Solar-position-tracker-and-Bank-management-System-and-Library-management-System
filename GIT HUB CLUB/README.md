Overview

The Solar Panel Sun-Position Tracking System is designed to optimize solar energy capture by automatically adjusting the solar panel orientation based on the sunâ€™s position. This increases efficiency compared to fixed panels and is ideal for renewable energy projects.

Features

Real-time sun position tracking using sensors or astronomical algorithms.

Automated motorized adjustment of solar panels.

Energy efficiency monitoring.

User-friendly interface (optional, if any dashboard is implemented).
